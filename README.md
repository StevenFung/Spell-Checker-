# Spell-Checker-

ïƒ˜	Using Java and compiled in C programming, we used a map to implement a spelling checker,
and read three files, document, dictionary, and my own dictionary, to compare and check if
the words are spelled wrong or not. Then output all misspelled words and the line numbers 
on which they occur.
